- There are 1549 employees elligible for the mentorship program
- There are a total of 90398 employees retiring soon

### Summary

Roughly 90,400 positions will need to be filled as the "Silver Tsunami" begins to make an impact. Assuming that the mentorship program will consist of a 1:1, mentor:mentee ratio, then there are not enough qualifed, retirement-ready employees for the program. Potential queries that may provide more insight include analyzing the relationship between retiring employees based on department and analyzing which titles have the highest number of elligble mentors so as to focus hiring effectively.
